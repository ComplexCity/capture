##What the script does
The script scraps [http://aqicn.org](http://aqicn.org) mobile page to get the air quality index in big cities.

The results are written in a JSON file (_YYYY-MM-DD-HH.json_).

This script could be run every hour.
##Files
###Specific files
-	_AqiCapture.py_
-	_AqiCaptor.py_
-	_FoursquareDatabaseManager.py_

###Common files
-	_Captor.py_
-	_FileManager.py_
-	_ExitLogger.py_
-	_LoggerBuilder.py_

###Additional Python modules
-	requests
-	lxml

###Logs
-	_./logs/aqi.log_ for complete logs 
-	_./logs/aqi-exit.json_ for time and exit status of the last execution

###Other files and directories

-	_./aqi/_ and the sub-folders for each city where the JSON files will be written
-	_./aqi/locations.json_

##How to use the script
1.	Copy the files
2.	Create the _logs_ folder
3.	Create the _aqi_ folder and its sub-folders for each city
4.	Create the _aqi/locations.json_ file and write a JSON dictionary where the key is the name of the city and the value is the part of the url associated to this city (the ### in http://aqicn.org/city/####/m/), e.g.:

		{
			"Paris":"france/paris/paris-centre",
			"Shanghai":"shanghai",
			"Beijing":"beijing",
			"NYC":"usa/newyork"
		}
 

5.	Run the script:

		python AqiCapture.py
		
##Exit status and Errors
###Exit status
-	0 in case of success
-	1 in case of an InitError (problem with the _./aqi/locations.json_ file or with the _./aqi/_ folder or sub-folders)
-	2 in case of a RequestException (e.g. network problem, HTTP error, timeout, too many redirections, etc.)
-	3 in case of another type of Exception

###Errors
	InitError: File ./aqi/locations.json is missing
=> You have forgotten to write the _./aqi/locations.json_ file

	InitError: The ./aqi/locations.json file does not contain any correct JSON object
=> See {How to use the script} to verify that your _./aqi/locations.json_ file is correctly written and check that you use " instead of ' for your keys and values.

	InitError: Folder ./aqi/{city} is missing
=> You need to create a sub_folder in _/aqi/_ for each city


##Good to know
-	The script uses an anonymous user agent to act like a normal browser.

-	For London and Tokyo, I couldn't decide which AQI specific location to useâ€¦
